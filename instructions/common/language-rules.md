# LANGUAGE PROCESSING RULES

## FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE: MORPHOSYNTACTIC CORRECTION WITH LEXICAL PRESERVATION
Grammatical well-formedness via morphosyntactic operations while maintaining speaker's lexical choices and idiolectal features

## PROGRESSIVE REFINEMENT STAGES

### Stage Definitions
- INT: Primary interpretation - resolve ambiguities, remove disfluencies
- INT1: Morphological correction - agreement, allomorphy, tense/aspect
- INT2: Syntactic integration - clause combining, conjunction integration, comma splices
- INT3: Final polish - punctuation, capitalization, prosodic boundaries

### Stage Principles
- Cumulative: each includes all prior corrections
- Progressive: no backtracking or reversal
- Optional: omit unused stages; modes may override purposes

## ORTHOGRAPHIC CONVENTIONS

### Code Delimitation
- Executable syntax: backticks (`command`, `function()`, `/path/to/file`)
- Proper nouns: standard typography (Linux, HTTP, Vosk, Gemini)

### Phrasal Marking
- Metalinguistic reference: quotation marks for conceptual units ("data type")

## NUMERICAL REPRESENTATION

### Cardinal Numbers
- Orthographic: zero, one, two, three
- Arabic: 4, 15, 100

### Special Cases
- Percentages: 25%
- Currency: $5
- Decimals: Preserve verbalized "dot" as period (3.14)
- Ordinals: Context-dependent ("first place", "May 1st")

## PROSODIC PUNCTUATION

### Verbalized Punctuation
- Explicit metalinguistic punctuation commands → orthographic realization
- Phonological representation → graphemic conversion
- "comma" → "," | "period" → "." | "exclamation" → "!"

### Interrogative Marking
- Syntactic interrogatives: obligatory question mark
- Imperatives: terminal period despite rising intonation
- Declaratives: period regardless of prosodic contour

### Exclamative Restraint
- Default to terminal period for declarative utterances
- Reserve exclamation marks for genuine exclamatives with lexical markers
- Emphasis via lexical intensification, not punctuation proliferation

## CONTRACTION RESOLUTION
- Negation: "don't" → "do not", "can't" → "cannot"
- Auxiliary: "I'll" → "I will", "we've" → "we have"

## DISCOURSE DISFLUENCY ELIMINATION

### Obligatory Deletions
- Filled pauses: paralinguistic hesitation markers (uh, um, ah, er)
- False starts: syntactically incomplete utterance fragments
- Performance errors: unintentional lexical reduplication
- Repetition disfluencies: adjacent identical lexemes without rhetorical function
- Discourse markers without propositional content: excessive "like", "you know"

### Self-Repair Processing
- Retain reparandum, delete original utterance
- Repair markers trigger deletion: "I mean", "actually", "rather", "no wait"
- "Send to John. No wait, to Jane" → "Send to Jane"

### Spelling Corrections
- Accept speaker-provided spelling: "Linux, L-I-N-U-X" → "Linux"

## GRAMMATICAL CORRECTION TAXONOMY

### OBLIGATORY CORRECTIONS

#### Morphological Agreement
- Subject-verb concord: singular/plural inflection alignment
- Pronoun-antecedent concordance: φ-features (person, number, gender)
- Determiner-noun agreement: demonstrative/quantifier concord

#### Syntactic Well-formedness
- Tense/aspect consistency: maintain temporal reference across discourse units
- Case assignment: nominative/accusative/genitive distribution
- Parallel structure: coordinate constituents require identical phrasal categories
- Article allomorphy: phonologically conditioned a/an alternation
- Modifier attachment: resolve ambiguous adjectival/adverbial scope
- Negative polarity: eliminate negative concord in standard varieties

#### Clause Integration
- Coordinating conjunction prohibition at sentence boundaries (FANBOYS: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so)
- Obligatory syntactic integration via comma or semicolon
- "I tried. And succeeded." → "I tried, and succeeded."
- Comma splice repair: independent clauses require proper coordination or subordination

### PROHIBITED MODIFICATIONS

#### Lexical Level
- Root morpheme substitution: preserve speaker's vocabulary choices
- Register shifting: maintain formality level of original utterance
- Semantic alteration: no paraphrasing or meaning changes

#### Syntactic Level
- Voice alternation: preserve active/passive as spoken
- Constituent reordering: maintain information structure (except conjunction integration)
- Cleft/pseudocleft transformation: preserve focus marking

#### Stylistic Level
- Pleonasm reduction when grammatically correct: "a thing that is" remains
- Verbosity adjustment: preserve speaker's elaboration patterns
- Idiomatic substitution: maintain speaker's phraseological choices

## SYNTACTIC COMPLEXITY ENHANCEMENT

### Paratactic to Hypotactic Transformation
- Obligatory coordination of semantically related independent clauses
- Subordination where logical dependency exists
- Professional register achieved through syntactic sophistication

### Clause Combining Criteria
- Topical continuity: shared referents across clauses
- Temporal adjacency: sequential events in discourse
- Causal relationship: result or consequence marking

### Transformation Examples
- Paratactic: "I went to store. There was bread. I bought some."
- Hypotactic: "I went to the store where there was bread, and I bought some."
- Principle: Maintain propositional content while increasing structural complexity

## PRESERVATION PRINCIPLES

### Invariant Lexical Elements
- Technical terminology: domain-specific vocabulary
- Modal force: deontic/epistemic distinctions (must/should/may)
- Lexical selection: speaker's vocabulary choices including informal markers
- Phraseological units: collocations and fixed expressions

### Invariant Stylistic Features
- Idiolectal patterns: individual speech characteristics
- Register markers: formality level indicators
- Discourse style: elaborative vs. concise patterns
- Information packaging: speaker's chosen focus structure

## EDITORIAL BOUNDARIES

### Permitted Operations
- Morphosyntactic correction: inflectional morphology, agreement features
- Punctuation insertion: syntactically motivated boundary marking
- Disfluency elimination: performance error removal
- Conjunction integration: clause-level coordination

### Prohibited Operations
- Semantic modification: propositional content alteration
- Stylistic normalization: register or formality adjustment
- Lexical enhancement: vocabulary sophistication
- Syntactic reordering: information structure modification

## FRAGMENT PROCESSING

### Elliptical Constructions
- Preserve syntactically incomplete but pragmatically felicitous utterances
- Contextually recoverable elements remain implicit
- Introducer phrases with colon: "what we need:" maintains fragment status

## ERROR HIERARCHY

### Priority Order
1. Agreement violations (morphosyntactic)
2. Structural ill-formedness (syntactic)
3. Conjunction placement (discourse)
4. Disfluency markers (performance)
5. Punctuation (orthographic)

## PROCESSING ALGORITHM

### Sequential Operations
1. Tokenization with prosodic boundary detection
2. Morphosyntactic parsing for error identification
3. Error classification via grammaticality judgment
4. Minimal edit distance correction application
5. Lexical invariance verification

### Constraint Ranking
Grammaticality >> Structural coherence >> Lexical fidelity >> Prosodic authenticity

### Minimal Correction Principle
- Apply fewest modifications necessary for well-formedness
- Preserve maximal lexical material from source utterance
- *the dogs is barking → the dogs are barking (single morpheme change)
- NOT: *the dogs is barking → the dog is barking (unnecessary number alteration)
