LANGUAGE FORMATTING RULES:

TECHNICAL TERMS:
- Backticks: terminal commands, function names, code needing monospace
  Examples: `ls`, `grep`, `main()`, `/usr/bin/python`
- NO formatting: proper nouns (Linux, HTTP, Vosk, Gemini)
- Test: Would you type this in terminal? → backticks

CONCEPTUAL PHRASES:
- Double quotes: phrases treated as single unit (air quotes)
  Examples: "transcribe audio" vs "transcribe text", "data type"
- Test: Conceptual distinction needing grouping? → double quotes

NUMBERS:
- 0-3: spell out ("zero", "one", "two", "three")
- 4+: digits ("4", "15", "100")
- Percentages: % ("25%")
- Currency: symbol ("$5")
- Ordinals: "first place" but "May 1st"
- Dot = period: "3.14" when speaker says "three dot fourteen"

CONTRACTIONS:
Expand for formal style:
- "don't" → "do not"
- "can't" → "cannot"

QUESTION MARKS:
Use ? for interrogative syntax only:
- "Why would we do that?" (interrogative, use ?)
- "List all sounds" (imperative command, no ?)
- "Show me the difference" (imperative, no ?)
- "I do not know why" (statement, no ?)

ELLIPSES:
- Remove all ellipses from edited output
- Pauses and hesitations are removed, not marked

COPY EDITING RULES:

MINIMAL EDITING DEFINITION:
Copy editing = fix grammar + remove fillers + add punctuation
Copy editing ≠ restructure, reorder, substitute
- Good: "well it seems" → "it seems" (filler removal)
- Bad: "it seems" → "that seems" (word substitution)

WORD SUBSTITUTION - NEVER:
❌ "who use" → "that use"
❌ "providing" → "including"
❌ "inner" → "in their"

Acceptable Edits:
- Fix grammar for readability
- Remove fillers: uh, ah, excessive "like"
- Reduce emphasis repetition: "very very" → "very"
- Add punctuation for clarity
- Clean stutters: "the the" → "the"
- Combine simple sentences into compound/complex structures

SELF-CORRECTIONS:
Use corrected version when speaker self-corrects:
- "Send it to John. No wait, send it to Jane" → "Send it to Jane"
- Signals: I mean, actually, rather, no wait, or

SPELLING PROVIDED:
Speaker spelling = correction:
- "Linux, L-I-N-U-X" → Use "Linux"

FALSE STARTS:
- Omit incomplete attempts
- "We need to... the system requires" → "The system requires"

SENTENCE FRAGMENTS:
- No capital or period (unless proper noun)
- "modify so that we can" → modify so that we can
- Exception: "what we need:" (colon for introduction)

SENTENCE STRUCTURE (PROFESSIONAL CLARITY):
- Minimize simple staccato sentences
- Combine into compound/complex structures
- Bad: "I went to store. There was bread. I bought some."
- Good: "I went to the store and bought some bread."
- Use conjunctions, commas, semicolons appropriately
- Professional business tone, not first-grade style

PRESERVE EXACTLY:
- Technical terminology
- Speaker's word choices
- Requirements language (must/should/can)

MINIMAL EDITING IN SPECIFIC CONTEXTS:
- When replacing content, preserve exact phrasing
- Fix only obvious errors (spelling, basic grammar)
- Do not restructure sentences unless explicitly asked
